### Project Components:
- Arduino Nano microcontroller: Controls the system and interacts with the sensors and actuators.
- DHT22 sensor: Measures temperature and humidity.
- Ultrasonic sensor: Measures distance to the plant or soil surface.
- Photoresistor sensor: Measures light intensity.
- ILI9341 LCD screen: Displays sensor readings and system status.
- Water pump: Provides water to the plants.
- LED grow light: Provides supplemental lighting.
- Soil moisture sensor: Measures the moisture level in the soil.

### Project Functionality:
- Data Acquisition: Sensors continuously collect data on environmental factors and plant growth conditions.
- Data Visualization: Sensor readings are displayed on the LCD screen in real-time.
- Automated Control: The system adjusts the water pump and LED grow light based on sensor readings to maintain optimal conditions for plant growth.
- User Interface: The LCD screen provides a user interface for monitoring the system and adjusting settings.

### Project Benefits:
- Increased Plant Growth: Optimizes environmental conditions for plant growth, leading to increased yields and healthier plants.
- Reduced Water Consumption: Automated watering system ensures plants receive the right amount of water, reducing waste.
- Reduced Maintenance: Automates tasks such as watering and lighting, reducing manual intervention.
- Real-Time Monitoring: The LCD screen provides real-time data on plant growth conditions, allowing for proactive adjustments.

### Project Applications:
- Home gardening: Allows the growth of herbs, vegetables, and flowers in a home environment.
- Commercial agriculture: Can be scaled up for use in commercial greenhouses and farms.
- Educational purposes: Can be used to teach students about plant science and technology.

### Project Future Development:
- Integration with mobile app: Develop a mobile app to remotely monitor and control the system.
